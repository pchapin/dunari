    <h1>Peter Chapin's Writings</h1>

    <p>Hello! This page contains links to my novels, poems, and other creative writings that I
    distribute under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> license
    (namely: CC BY-SA). My approach is to use standard software development tools to manage my
    writing. These tools are powerful, flexible, and support the creation of large, complex
    works authored by multiple contributors. I am inspired by the open source software movement,
    and I intend to follow many of the practices and traditions developed by that community
    while developing and distributing the works presented here.</p>

    <p>Specifically: Under the terms of the CC BY-SA license you are able to copy and distribute
    these works freely, even for commercial purposes. You are also able to modify these works
    and distribute the modified versions, provided you acknowledge me as the original copyright
    holder and use the same CC BY-SA license on the modified versions. For more details, consult
    the license file in the repositories linked here or the Creative Commons web site.</p>

    <p>I use the <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> site for storing the source of the
    works provided here. Using GitHub you are allowed (and encouraged) to submit "issues"
    against these works ranging from typos through global problems with story consistency,
    character development, and plot and setting issues, to name a few things. You are also
    allowed (and encouraged) to clone my repositories and contribute changes via "pull requests"
    in the usual way on GitHub. I may release updated versions of these works in the future that
    include responses to submitted issues and contributed changes.</p>

    <h2><b>The Dunari</b> (novel)</h2>

    <p>Living on a desert planet around a red dwarf star, the dunari wrestle with their
    technological adolescence. Unexpectedly they are visited by an advanced, star-faring
    civilization, the humans, who stumbled on their world looking for a place to build a
    scientific research facility. An uneasy relationship between the dunari and the humans
    unfold amid political and social uncertainty. Meanwhile a young, dunari mathematical genius
    and a human astro-physicist form an unlikely friendship and discover something so profound
    that it will forever change the way both races see themselves---and each other.</p>

    <ul>

    <h2><b>WriterDaemon</b></h2>

    <p>WriterDaemon is not a work of prose or poetry. It is an open source program I'm working
    on designed to assist a creative writer with various tasks. It is currently highly immature,
    but it does know to count lines in LaTeX documents!</p>
