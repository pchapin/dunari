The Dunari
==========

Told entirely from the point of view of an alien species living on a planet around a red dwarf
star, this story is about their first encounter with humans and how the two species get along.
It outlines the development of a friendship between a human astro-physicist and a dunari
mathematical genius and how together they make a profound discovery.

This story is really a first contact story on two levels. At the more immediate level it's about
first contact between the dunari and the humans. However, the discovery made by the two species
together is that they are being contacted by an extremely powerful civilization, the precise
nature of which is left unspecified.
