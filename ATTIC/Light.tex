One of the displays on light was about the different colors emitted from objects at different
temperatures. It showed a chart with the visible light spectrum and also the sub-rubinum and
ultra-green regions as well. Rachel studied the chart with interest.

``I can only see to about here,'' she said pointing just to the left of the red region.

Colty was surprised. ``You can't see rubinum?'' he asked.

``No,'' said Rachel. She pointed at the rubinum band on the chart. ``To me that just looks
black.'' Then she moved her finger to the ultra-green part of the chart. ``I can see up here,
though.''

``How interesting,'' said Colty.

``We call this color \alien{blue}.''
