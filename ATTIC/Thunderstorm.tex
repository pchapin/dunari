There was a rumble outside and Rachel turned her head.

``That sounds like thunder,'' Colty said. He stood up and went to the window. Thick clouds were
moving in from the east, darkening the sky. Joleia and Rachel joined him. ``It's a nernast,'' he
said.

``What's that?'' asked Rachel.

``Sometimes the Nermela gets turbulent,'' he said. ``Cool air from the night moves in and these
nernast storms develop. Look at the trees.'' He pointed his trunk. ``The wind is blowing
backward now.'' There was a flash and then moments later a loud clap of thunder.

``Let's get the dishes done,'' Joleia said. The three of them cleared the table and the two
dunari hosts then set to work buffing the dishes.

Rachel watched the storm through the window. ``It is building quickly.''

``Yes, that's normal,'' Colty called out. There was a bright flash and then a loud explosive
booming that seemed to almost shake the building. Rachel backed away from the widnow with alarm.
Colty went to her. ``Do you have thunderstorms on Earth?'' he asked.

``We do, but I don't think as intense as this.''

``Colty, can you get a light?'' Joleia asked nervously. Colty went to his closet and took out an
artifical light. He put it on the table and started it. On the street below quite a few dunari
were outside on their porches to avoid the gloomy darkness. Rachel watched with fascination.

Then the rain started.
