Living on a desert planet around a red dwarf star, the dunari wrestle with their technological
adolescence. Unexpectedly they are visited by an advanced, star-faring civilization, the humans,
who stumbled on their world looking for a place to build a scientific research facility. An
uneasy relationship between the dunari and the humans unfold amid political and social
uncertainty. Meanwhile a young, dunari mathematical genius and a human astro-physicist form an
unlikely friendship and discover something so profound that it will forever change the way both
races see themselves---and each other.
